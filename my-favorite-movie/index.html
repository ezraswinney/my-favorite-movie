            <h3>Storyline</h3>
            <p>
                In an era when terrifying beasts roamed the seas, monster hunters were celebrated heroes and none were more beloved than the great Jacob Holland. But when young Maisie Brumble stows away on his fabled ship, he's saddled with an unexpected ally. Together they embark on an epic journey into uncharted waters and make history.

            <h3>Animation and design</h3>
            <p>
                Animation services were provided by Sony Pictures Imageworks in Vancouver who have provided new technology build upon the film.[5] For the look and feel of the film, they were drawn close to the artwork of N. C. Wyeth for the wide open oceans and Caspar David Friedrich for low contrast on the cinematic looks of the film. To match the wrinkles around Captain Crow, the inkline tool used for Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse was reworked into crease-lines to give custom wrinkles to curve depth in a more sculptural way around Crow's face. For the camera shots on the ship, a new camera tool was developed to counterbalance the camera to scenes set on the ship or the boat for a more live-action approach from the classic sea monster films along with a new pivoting tool called Sea Legs, which was engineered for characters balancing on moving surfaces. Another new tool that was used for the webs in Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse was a new animation rig used on the ropes from the ship with more flexibility and control over how much rope was used in the film.[6]
